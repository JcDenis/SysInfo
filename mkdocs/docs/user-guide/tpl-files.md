Each "potential" template file is listed, with its source path and the related cache path and filename.

![Template file preview](../img/sysinfo-tpl-preview.jpg)

If a compiled template file exists, you can preview it by clicking on its cache filename or select it for deletion. Related commands are displayed below the list:

	You can also delete all compiled template files by using the related command in the **Maintenance** plugins
